**Revolutionary approach to data compression through pattern mining and decentralized storage.**

## 🚀 What is PatternMiner?

PatternMiner implements **"Digital Geology"** - a new paradigm where:
- Data patterns are mined like precious minerals
- Miners earn cryptocurrency (PatternCoin) for discovering useful patterns
- Compression improves over time as more patterns are discovered
- Long-term storage is incentivized with time-based rewards

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **GUI Mining Interface** - Real-time pattern mining with visual feedback  
✅ **PatternCoin Cryptocurrency** - Demo blockchain with wallet system  
✅ **Compression Algorithms** - Grouping + BWT + ZIP for compressing already compressed data  
✅ **Time-Based Storage Rewards** - The longer you store data, the higher the reward  
✅ **Modular Architecture** - Easy to extend and integrate  

## 🎯 The Vision

We're building a **decentralized data compression network** where:
1. Miners find patterns in data
2. Patterns are stored in a global pattern repository (PR)
3. Everyone benefits from improved compression ratios
4. Storage providers earn rewards for long-term data preservation
5. Integration with Bittensor for distributed AI training
